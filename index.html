		<p align ="center" style="font-size 20px;color:white;margin-right:50%;">The organization was officially launched as a treatment care and support<br>
		group on May 09, 2009 at the Episcopal Training Center in Matina, Davao <br>
		City under the care and support services of the Alliance Against AIDS in <br>
		Mindanao (ALAGAD Mindanao) with 16 founding members. <br>
		Programs undertaken by the organization focus on learning sessions, group <br>
		discussions, training and seminars/capacity building, consultations, <br>
		lobbying, advocacy, and networking. Moreover, care and support services <br>
		rendered by the organization incorporate peer/family counseling, <br>
		referrals, home-based and hospice care, and palliative Care.
		<h1 align="center" style="font-size:30px;font-family:Balsamiq Sans;color:white;margin-left:50%;margin-top:-15%;">Organizer</h1>
		<p align ="center" style="font-size 20px;color:white;margin-left:50%;">Davao City is under the care and support services of the<br>
		Alliance Against AIDS in Mindanao (ALAGAD Mindanao) with<br>
		16 founding members. The Mindanao AIDS Advocates <br>
		Association found its first home in the office of ALAGAD <br>
		Mindanao, Inc. located at #557 Kamuning Street, Juna Subd. <br>
		Matina, Davao City. The Mindanao AIDS Advocates Association <br>
		Inc. came into being, eventually becoming an organization <br>
		that is helping affect the HIV-related local efforts.

		<h1 align="center" style="font-size:30px;font-family:Balsamiq Sans;color:white;margin-right:50%;">Beneficiaries</h1>
		<p align ="center" style="font-size 20px;color:white;margin-right:50%;">According to the paper, the institution serves children between the ages<br>
		of 6 and 12. This includes more than 100 clients each month between the <br>
		ages of 13 and 19 and more than 800 clients per month for those who are <br>
		20 years of age and older. Some of these patients have tuberculosis and <br>
		malaria, and some are reported to have HIV/AIDS. These sick people seek <br>
		medical care from The Global Fund (GF) to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and <br>
		Malaria to receive treatment for their diseases.

		<h1 align="center" style="font-size:30px;font-family:Balsamiq Sans;color:white;margin-left:50%;margin-top:-15%;">Benefactors</h1>
		<p align ="center" style="font-size 20px;color:white;margin-left:50%;">Our section is assigned to help the partner institution but as for our <br>
		group, we have three ideas on how to help their patients. The ADDU JHS <br>
		Community is to maintain gender sensitivity and a non-stigmatizing <br>
		environment while working with the organization. The partnership will <br>
		certainly help strengthen existing partnerships in terms of HIV <br>
		prevention and early access to treatment with ADDU's assistance.
