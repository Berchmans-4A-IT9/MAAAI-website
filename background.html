<p align="center" style="font-size:35px;color:white;margin-top:-30%;"><font face="Poppins">The MAAAI has been unable to access HIV treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Another issue the institution is dealing with is an increase in HIV cases and evidence of minors' early sexual encounters. 
The MAAAI Institution is said to provide free HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria tests, which is why many individuals who cannot afford expensive hospital treatment come here instead. 
However, the pandemic affected the institution in such a way that they would have trouble accessing treatment for their patients, requiring our assistance. 
Our school is said to provide early access to treatment through online HIV outreach and teleconsultations, while also maintaining gender sensitivity and a non-stigmatizing environment for the partner community.

<p style="font-size:25px;color:822A23;">Our project’s main objective is to show the patients at the partner institution that they
belong to the community and are not societal outcasts. To fulfill this, we will be
treating them with gifts, holding forums on their mental health, and engaging in
online dialogues and socializing with HIV-positive patients to express our support for
the struggles they are currently facing. To reach our goal, we will need a lot of
support from everyone. In addition to accepting gift donations, we will also be buying
more presents for the patients. Feel free to visit our website for more information, and any donations are highly appreciated.

<p align="center" style="font-size:20px;color:white;margin-right:70%;"><font face="Poppins">Knowing that these ailments, diseases, and <br>
illnesses are endangering our health,<br>
The MAAI wishes to convey one message to us:<br>
take action to address this issue and save lives. <br>
The institution’s mission is to provide access to <br>
healthcare for all inhabitants, which will help the <br>
neighborhood achieve holistic health. Programs<br>
undertaken by the organization focus on learning <br>
sessions, group discussions,training and <br>
seminars/capacity building, consultations, <br>
lobbying, advocacy, and networking. The Mindanao <br>
AIDS Advocates Association Inc. came into being,<br>
eventually becoming an organization that is helping<br>
affect the HIV related local efforts. Some of these<br>
patients have tuberculosis and malaria, and some are<br>
reported to have HIV/AIDS. These sick people seek <br>
medical care from The Global Fund (GF) to Fight AIDS, <br>
Tuberculosis, and Malaria to receive treatment for their<br>
diseases. HIV prevention and early access to treatment <br>
are said to be offered by Ateneo de Davao University <br>
as a support to the institution. The ADDU JHS<br>
Community is to maintain gender sensitivity and a <br>
non-stigmatizing environment while working with the organization.

<p align="center" style="font-size:20px;color:white;margin-right:8%;margin-top:1%;"><font face="Poppins">
The Men and Women HIV/AIDS Prevention:Treatment Plan <br> 
is important because it helps eliminate the increasing<br>
number of HIV/AIDS cases together with other<br>
diseases like malaria, tuberculosis and more. <br>
It will affect the community’s holistic health and<br>
protect them from the major outcome caused <br>
by the stated illnesses. With the help of the <br>
ADDU JHS students we have created such an<br>
alternative to also contribute by implementing<br> 
this project which provides Forums, Gift Giving <br>
Program/Donations to PLHIV and Online<br>
Dialogue with the HIV Patients. As we are aware of<br>
and have drawn attention to address such <br>
health problems we face today. With the <br>
implemented project we expand and make a <br>
decision to create more alternatives that would<br> 
let people be conscious of their surroundings <br>
(communal challenges) and not let them into <br>
misconceptions of what things should be done.

<p align="center" style="font-size:20px;color:white;margin-left:50%;margin-top:-px;"><font face="Poppins">The success indicators of our project is shown through the level of understanding of our 
participants from our forums, activities on the issue of HIV/AIDS. With the feedback and 
evaluation we get from our participants it shows concrete evidence that the accomplishment of
desired objectives will be evaluated by participants through a “before-after” evaluation and the 
application of specific questionnaires which will assess participant’ knowledge and satisfaction 
with the organization. Such accomplishment of objectives will be evaluated by the same 
“before-after” evaluation. While the health strategies will be also evaluated according to their
objective and action plans to know, what are the strengths and failures of such action plans and 
whether such health strategies were delivered appropriately. This enables us to demonstrate 
our program’s success or progress as with the information that was collected allows us to better
communicate our program’s impact to others, which is critical for public relations, staff morale, 
and attracting and retaining support from current and potential funders.

As we all know, HIV is a virus that spreads through sexual contact and some people believe they aren't allowed to come into contact with them. 
With the online conversations, forums, and gift-giving we will offer, we can guarantee that the patients are reminded of how much they are loved and valued by everyone.
